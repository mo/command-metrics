# command-metrics

command-metrics is a script that can periodally save measurements for things
that can be measured using a shell command that prints a single integer or float
value.

command-metrics also offers some basic analysis features like selecting a range
and seeing how much each series changed both in absolute numbers and as a
percentage during that period.
